Hi, I'm Charles, an electrical engineering student at Grand Valley State University. I'm passionate about electric and magnetic phenomina, and I'm constantly learning and experimenting to grow my skills.

Through my studies, I've had the opportunity to work on projects such as a custom karaoke machine and a full size trivia/skeeball game and I'm constantly eager to apply things I learn to real world challenges.

When I'm not studying or working on projects, you can find me travelling, rock climbing or skateboarding. Feel free to explore my portfolio and connect. I'd love to collaborate or hear your thoughts!
